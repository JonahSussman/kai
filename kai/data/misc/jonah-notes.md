# Jonah Notes

## Questions
- Where does the git repo live? On the client on the server?
  - If on the client, cost of sending necessary stuff back and forth?
  - If on the server, how to sync repo?

## Postgres database

what about variables?

Incident Database:
- app name
- rule set name
- violation name
- incident uri
- incident code snip before
- incident diff that solved it

Assuming rule set name and violation name are "unique enough"

Prefer same app
