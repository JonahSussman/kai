# format is a verb that takes the argument, finds the section, it applies to,
# and applies all the variables it asks for. If key is present, it will use the
# surrounding dict's key. If the key returns a list, it will concatenate all the
# stuff in that list's results. Returns a the formatted string if success, None
# if failure
