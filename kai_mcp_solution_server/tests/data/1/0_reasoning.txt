In this refactored code, we have replaced the deprecated Java EE API with the Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent. We have also used the @Incoming annotation to define the message channel for consuming the order messages. Additionally, we have used the @Transactional annotation to ensure that the inventory update is performed within a transaction.
